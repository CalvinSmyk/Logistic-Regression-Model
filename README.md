# Logistic-Regression-Model

Image Classification using Logistic Regression

This project implements logistic regression for image classification. It includes three Python files:

LogisticRegression.py: Contains the main logic for training and testing the logistic regression model.

DataReader.py: Implements functions for reading and preprocessing the data.

main.py: A simple script that trains the model on the training data and evaluates its performance on the test data.

Installation
To use this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

After installing Python, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Download the dataset in a .npy format from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/USERNAME/DATASET-NAME

Place the dataset in a folder named data in the same directory as the Python files.

Open main.py and adjust the parameters as needed, such as num_iterations and learning_rate.

Run main.py in your terminal:

css
Copy code
python main.py
The program will output the accuracy of the model on the test data.
